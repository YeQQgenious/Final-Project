    "text": "1. Introduction\nChicago’s 311 system provides an important channel through which residents report non-emergency service needs. While individual requests are operationally useful, aggregated analysis is necessary to understand neighborhood-level service patterns.\nThis project analyzes Chicago 311 complaint data to identify similarities in service demand across communities. By clustering neighborhoods based on complaint profiles and visualizing results through maps, the project demonstrates how civic data can support more informed and equitable service planning.\n\n\n2. Data Source and Acquisition\n311 service request data were obtained from the Chicago Open Data Portal using the Socrata API. Data acquisition and analysis were conducted entirely in R to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n\nsource(\"scripts/01_get_311.R\")\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'jsonlite' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\nStep 1: Retrieving data from the Chicago 311 API\n\n\nThe original data has been saved to data/raw_311.csv\n\n\nRows: 50,000\nColumns: 47\n$ sr_number                     &lt;chr&gt;

The map allows users to explore spatial patterns and compare service needs across neighborhoods.\n\n\n6. Key Findings\n\n311 complaint types are unevenly distributed across communities.\nClustering reveals meaningful differences in service demand structures.\nSpatial visualization highlights geographic concentrations of specific service issues.\n\nThese findings demonstrate that community-level patterns are not random, but reflect underlying differences in infrastructure, environment, and reporting behavior.\n\n\n7. Ethical and Equity Considerations\n311 data reflects reported needs rather than true service demand. Reporting behavior varies by access to technology, language, trust in government, and awareness of the 311 system. As a result, low complaint volume should not be interpreted as low need.\nCluster results should be used as diagnostic signals rather than direct inputs for punitive or exclusionary policy decisions. Responsible use requires combining 311 data with additional sources and community engagement.\n\n\n8. Conclusion\nThis project illustrates how civic data analytics can transform large volumes of service requests into actionable insights. Through clustering and mapping of 311 complaints, the analysis highlights neighborhood-level service patterns while emphasizing the importance of equity-aware interpretation.\nThe fully reproducible workflow demonstrates the value of open data, transparent methods, and responsible civic technology practices."
